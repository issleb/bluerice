Blue Rice was a college comic strip that ran in the Daily Illini (Champaign-Urbana) from 1999-2002. After a nine-year hiatus, it has come out of retirement to help you waste time at work.

Featured here are the first 280ish Blue Rice strips as well as 16 new ones, with more on the way soon. (Please forgive the early ones.) I'm also adding strip-by-strip, behind-the-scenes commentary, which now runs through the first 177 comics.

Blue Rice has always been driven by its fans, so be sure to share your comments here and on Facebook. The more you read, the more I draw!

Enjoy,
